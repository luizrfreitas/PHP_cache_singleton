# Default PHP CRUD

## Introduction
In an effort to standardize PHP projects, this repository encapsulates essential components like Composer, Nginx, MySQL, and more into one standardized repository.

## Installation
Before proceeding with the installation, replace the `example.env` file with the actual `.env` file.

Currently, there are two environment options: development and production. You can use the Makefile to build both environments, either with `build-project-dev` or `build-project-prod`.

## Supported Services
* PHP 8.3
